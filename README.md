### Hello! 

<img src="1664870383551.jfif" width="150">

I'm Nicola Slater-Arnold and I'm switching career from journalism to coding. I've pursued this dream by doing the following:

- 🐍 A gruelling but fun Python bootcamp with HyperionDev
- 🖥️ Angela Yu's web development and 100 days of Python bootcamps 
- ☁️ Adrian Cantrill's AWS Solutions Architect course

All of this coupled with the fact that I have an eight-month-old baby means that I rarely sleep and when I do I dream in code. 

A little about me: 

- 🤓 My tech stack: Python, JavaScript, AWS, HTML, React
- 📫 nicolaslaterarnold@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
