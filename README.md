### Hello! 

<img src="1664870383551.jfif" width="150">

I'm Nicola Slater-Arnold and I'm seeking a career change from journalism to coding. At the moment I'm pursuing this dream by doing: 

- 🐍 A gruelling but fun Python bootcamp with HyperionDev
- 🖥️ Angela Yu's web development bootcamp 
- ☁️ Adrian Cantrill's AWS Solutions Architect course

All of this coupled with the fact that I have a six-month-old baby means that I rarely sleep and when I do I dream in code. 

A little about me: 

- 🤓 I’m learning: Python, JavaScript, AWS, HTML, React
- 📫 nicolaslaterarnold@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- 🧓 My GitHub username is a reference to the fact that I'm learning to code at the ripe old age of 33 (and my last name)
